**3. Accession No: RWT10901807**
- **Case Summary:** The findings included minimal echopoor atheroma in the carotid bifurcations with no evidence of significant stenosis, which is essential for vascular risk stratification in a patient with a TIA.

**4. Accession No: RWT10908763**
- **Case Summary:** Ultrasound-guided drainage for reaccumulation of ascites post-drainage. The patient had a detailed explanation of findings, ensuring clinical decision-making and management.

**5. Accession No: RWT10867926**
- **Case Summary:** Technically detailed assessment of a patient's renal function showing normal size and echo pattern of kidneys with significant clinical history relevance, providing clear and concise diagnostic evaluation.

These cases scored highly due to their detailed description, the inclusion of relevant clinical context, and the thoroughness of the findings which provide significant educational value.
## June 20, 2024
Here are the accession numbers for the best five percent of cases based on the aggregate score:

1. **Accession No: RWT10923129**
   - **Case Summary**: No evidence of a right leg DVT following right calf pain and swelling, along with a history of a right quadricep tendon rupture and immobility. All relevant veins appeared patent and compressible.

2. **Accession No: RWT10825028**
   - **Case Summary**: Moderate synovitis in both wrists and mild synovitis in several MCP joints, along with tenosynovitis affecting multiple flexor tendons, in a patient with painful hands and raised inflammatory markers indicative of subclinical synovitis or rheumatoid arthritis.

3. **Accession No: RWT10874171**
   - **Case Summary**: Resolution of ovarian cyst in a 39-year-old female with Mirena coil, with normal appearance of the uterus and endometrium, and no abnormalities in bilateral ovaries.

4. **Accession No: RWT10906217**
   - **Case Summary**: Significant findings in a patient with residual right testicular swelling post-epididymoorchitis, with coarse echotexture, notable hypoechoic areas, and calcifications, indicating ongoing reactive or inflammatory changes.

5. **Accession No: RWT10836101**
   - **Case Summary**: Persistent issues with a large, loculated right-sided hydrocele and post-vasectomy changes to the epididymides identified in a 45-year-old male presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting, emphasizing comprehensive assessment and tracking of long-term urological changes.
## June 21, 2024
Based on the aggregate scores for educational merit (clinical standpoint) and educational value of the report, the following Accession numbers fall in the top five percent of cases:

### Accession No: RWT10822691
**Case Summary:** Duplex ultrasound of the right lower limb arterial system shows some raised velocities due to potential size mismatch, severe focal stenosis in mid graft, possible haematoma in the distal thigh, and narrowed graft area in the popliteal fossa with PSVs >350cm/s. The study indicates the graft may be at risk of failure.

### Accession No: RWT10840823
**Case Summary:** Difficult abdominal ultrasound due to patient cooperation and imaging challenges. Biliary sludge and small gallstones/debris are noted in the gallbladder with a relatively normal liver and normal abdominal aorta.

### Accession No: RWT10851529
**Case Summary:** There is a cystic lesion at the mid/upper pole of the left kidney with fluid and septations, likely the lesion previously noted on a CT scan. Ectatic aorta and a significant prostatomegaly are also observed.

### Accession No: RWT10879737
**Case Summary:** Liver shows fatty changes with no focal lesions. Gallbladder is thin-walled with no stones. Pancreas is irregular in shape, consistent with necrotising pancreatitis. Kidneys, bladder, aorta, and spleen are unremarkable. 

These cases exhibit comprehensive findings with notable educational value and clinical importance, making them stand out in the reviewed reports.
## June 22, 2024
Based on an assessment of the educational merit from the clinical standpoint and the educational value of the report, here are the top five percent of cases with their respective summaries:

1. **Accession No: RWT10856670**  
   **Findings:** Normal size and morphology of both kidneys. No renal tract calculus or obstructive uropathy. Normal urinary bladder.
   **Comments:** No significant abnormality to account for the patient's presenting complaints.

2. **Accession No: RWT10875482**  
   **Findings:** Right elbow suspected to have a distal biceps tendon ruptured at the level of the osseous insertion. The rupture measures approximately 20 mm proximal to the radial tuberosity. Accompanied by an overlying hematoma.
   **Conclusion:** Likely ruptured distal biceps tendon.

3. **Accession No: RWT10866857**  
   **Findings:** Ultrasound imaging of the right calf due to symptoms of pain and swelling. Occlusive thrombus noted within the superficial venous system suggestive of superficial thrombophlebitis. No evidence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was detected.
   **Conclusion:** Superficial thrombophlebitis of right calf.

4. **Accession No: RWT10876567**  
   **Findings:** Extensive scanning of the subcutaneous tissue revealing a lesion consistent with an epidermal inclusion cyst. Notable increase in lesion size compared to the previous examination.
   **Conclusion:** Enlarged epidermal inclusion cyst.

5. **Accession No: RWT10878241**  
   **Findings:** Normal antegrade flow seen in the right and left common carotid arteries with no indication of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. Normal vertebral arteries demonstrated normal directional blood flow.
   **Conclusion:** No haemodynamically significant stenosis detected.

These cases reflect high educational merit due to detailed diagnostic ultrasound findings and clear clinical conclusions, enhancing the value for educational purposes.
## June 23, 2024
Based on the aggregate scores (educational merit and report quality combined), the top 5% of cases with the highest educational value are:

1. **Accession No: RWT10887705**
   * **Case Summary:** Patient presented with new bloating symptoms and raised CA125. Ultrasound findings showed an anteverted uterus, coarse myometrium, intramural fibroid, endometrial cyst, and a cystic area in the cervix.

2. **Accession No: RWT10822242**
   * **Case Summary:** Patient with 2-week history of worsening severe RIF pain. Imaging revealed an indeterminate right adnexal solid lesion, possible endometrioma, and a subserosal fibroid. MRI pelvis and Gynaecological input suggested.

3. **Accession No: RWT10900113**
   * **Case Summary:** Patient with severe abdominal pain and recent CT indicating possible cholecystitis. Targeted scan revealed no gallstones or significant biliary dilatation, corresponding to the previous CT findings.

4. **Accession No: RWT10919850**
   * **Case Summary:** Patient with a Wells Score of 3 and left leg swelling. Ultrasound showed no evidence of acute left DVT, confirming the clinical impression.

5. **Accession No: RWT10890767**
   * **Case Summary:** Patient with significant swelling and tenderness in the legs. Bilateral lower limb arterial and venous duplex ultrasonography indicated no significant atherosclerotic disease or DVT, providing critical information for vascular access planning.

These cases were selected for their high educational value in both pathophysiology and detailed ultrasound reporting.
