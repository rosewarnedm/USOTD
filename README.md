Here are the accession numbers for the top 5% of cases with positive pathology based on the aggregate score:

1. **Accession No: RWT10836232**
   - **Brief Case Summary:** Examination performed for perianal pain revealed a normal size prostate but prostatitis could not be excluded. Suggested MRI for further investigation.

2. **Accession No: RWT10857895**
   - **Brief Case Summary:** Ultrasound revealed gallstones, limited pancreatic views, echo bright renal cortices suggestive of parenchymal dysfunction, and a simple renal cyst.

3. **Accession No: RWT10820495**
   - **Brief Case Summary:** Ultrasound showed 70-79% diameter stenosis in right proximal ICA, 84% area reduction at right distal CCA by direct measurement, and an ulcerated plaque extending from the right carotid bulb to proximal ICA.

4. **Accession No: RWT10913504**
   - **Brief Case Summary:** Examination found a ruptured/haemorrhagic Bakers cyst in the medial aspect of the popliteal fossa with mild to moderate oedema in the calf.

5. **Accession No: RWT10803680**
   - **Brief Case Summary:** Evaluation for post-coital bleeding revealed left subserosal fibroids and a significant size ovarian cyst with features of endometrioma.

These cases were selected for their educational merit and detailed findings which contribute to a better clinical understanding and decision-making process.

The following are the top five percent of cases with positive pathology based on the aggregate educational merit and report scores:

### Best Radiology Reports:

#### Accession No: RWT10907557
**Case Summary:** Known liver cirrhosis with heterogenous and coarse echotexture. No hepatic lesions seen. Portal vein occluded with no flow, probable collateral vessel formation, and possible recannulised umbilical vein. Splenomegaly with splenic varices noted.

#### Accession No: RWT10822691
**Case Summary:** Right lower limb arterial duplex revealing multiple stenoses including a severe focal stenosis in the mid graft and a narrowed area in the graft in the popliteal fossa area indicating the graft may be at risk of failure.

#### Accession No: RWT10870598
**Case Summary:** 75-year-old male with bihemispheric ischemic stroke showing subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries patent with no significant stenosis or thrombus, and triphasic waveforms detected throughout.

#### Accession No: RWT10914835
**Case Summary:** Carotid artery duplex showing a moderate volume of echopoor plaque within the right bifurcation extending into the proximal right ICA, and moderate intimal thickening of the left CCA. No hemodynamically significant stenosis.

#### Accession No: RWT10910283
**Case Summary:** Ultrasound showing splenomegaly (141mm) with a simple cyst in the right kidney (14mm). Suboptimal scan due to habitus and bowel gas. Normal liver and spleen.

These cases were chosen based on their rich clinical and radiological findings, which provide valuable educational insights from both clinical and technical standpoints.
## June 21, 2024
The radiology reports were carefully reviewed, and only the cases with positive pathology were considered for further evaluation. The following are the best five percent of cases based on the aggregate score of educational merit from the clinical standpoint and the educational value of the report:

1. **Accession No: RWT10851410**
   **Case Summary:** A 70-year-old female with a background of HTN, hysterectomy, and high cholesterol presented with RUQ pain and non-bilious vomiting. Ultrasonography findings were suggestive of cholecystitis with tiny gallstones.

2. **Accession No: RWT10904892**
   **Case Summary:** Ultrasound-guided drainage of ascites in a patient with reaccumulation post drainage, revealing slightly blood-stained free-flowing ascitic fluid.

3. **Accession No: RWT10886622**
   **Case Summary:** Ultrasound findings consistent with acute cholecystitis, including a thickened gallbladder wall and pericholecystic fluid in a patient with RUQ pain.

4. **Accession No: RWT10917420
